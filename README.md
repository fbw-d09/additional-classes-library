# Mini Library :blue_book: :open_book::notebook_with_decorative_cover::orange_book:


Your task is to create a Book class representing a library.

1. Book
Write a Book class that should have 4 properties

a title as a string

an author as a string
an isbn as a number

isCurrentlyAvailable as a boolean (true as a default value)

The constructor should take 4 parameters initializing those properties. For example


```js
 const atomicHabbits = new Book("Atomic Habbits", "James Clear", 87254612)
 const steveJobs = new Book("Steve Jobs Biography", "Walter Isaacson", 5561246)
```
---

The class should also have a method called `isBookAvailable()`

```js
atomicHabbits.isBookAvailable() //Atomic Habbits is currently available.
```
